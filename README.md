# 🧶 Fil Rouge Project — Pattern Sharing Platform

The **Fil Rouge** project is a personal full-stack web application designed to allow users to create, share, and interact with visual patterns and creative models. Originally built for a community of knitting, crochet, or pixel-art enthusiasts, this platform encourages creativity and social engagement.

This project was developed alongside my Bac+2 Web Developer training (DWWM) and demonstrates both front-end and back-end capabilities.
